pg_to_gviz_basic
================

LRE DMI - from pg table to JSON for GViz, plus other options 

started as a way to create a json web service as a data source
for a google data visualization from a postgresql table or query,
mainly when the gviz is embedded in a drupal page when fetchit
is being used, but has evolved to support other output options.
